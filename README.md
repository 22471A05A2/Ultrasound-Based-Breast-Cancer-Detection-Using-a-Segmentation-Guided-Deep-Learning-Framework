# Ultrasound-Based Breast Cancer Detection Using a Segmentation-Guided Deep Learning Framework

This deep learning project classifies breast ultrasound images into benign, malignant, or normal using a U-Net++ segmentation-guided architecture. Trained on the BUSI dataset, the model achieved a training accuracy of 99.69% and a testing accuracy of 99.07%, supporting early and reliable medical diagnosis.
